## Notes

* I have extracted the data fro first 2 days of February 2007 manually in subset.txt. This was easy and convenient, as the original data file has 2,075,259 rows.
* Before running the scripts make sure the subset.txt is in the working directory.
* The PNG files are created in the same working directory.
